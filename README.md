# RU SkazOff Theme

Hey there! 👋

This is a custom WordPress theme I created for my Russian blog [ru.skazoff.com](https://ru.skazoff.com) with a little help from my AI friend. Actually, to be honest, AI did most of the heavy lifting while I was just guiding the process and making sure everything works as intended.

The theme is intentionally minimalistic and focuses on what matters most - content readability. It features a clean design with both light and dark modes, responsive layout, and smooth animations. I wanted it to be simple yet modern, without any unnecessary bloat.

Some cool features that made it into the theme:
- Seamless dark/light mode switching
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clean typography optimized for reading
- Fast loading times
- Search functionality
- Social media integration

The whole development process was quite an interesting experiment in AI-assisted coding. While I have some programming background, I wanted to see how far we could go with AI doing most of the actual coding work. Turns out, pretty far! 

Feel free to check out the theme in action at [ru.skazoff.com](https://ru.skazoff.com) or browse through the code here. It's not perfect, but it does exactly what I need it to do - presents my blog posts in a clean, readable way.

Cheers! 🚀

P.S. The theme is still a work in progress, and I'm planning to add more features and improvements over time.
